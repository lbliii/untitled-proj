The application we are working together on is a play-by-post roleplay forum application that uses SvelteKit, PocketBase, TailwindCSS, Zod, and DaisyUI. Always opt to use an existing zod schema if one exists for the data you are working with. If no schema exists, create one using zod and place it in the src/lib/schemas directory.
